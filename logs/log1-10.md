# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Decided to work on a project I've wanted to make, decided to develop in React-Native. Created the repo, and started working on some basic routing.

**Thoughts:** I need to figure out routing in r-n.

###Day 2: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** My step dad mentioned his difficulties for analyzing stock data, and I thought that it'd be a pretty easily thing to automate. Unfortunately, some of the sites that he used did not have any apis, so I learned how to utilize selenium, and wrote a python script to do it for him. He wanted it output into an excel file, so I just output it into a .csv file that he can open in excel.

**Thoughts:** Wasn't too hard. I ran into some road blocks, mostly with remembering how to do large array manipulations. I looked back onto some of the code I wrote in undergrad to analyze astronomical data. Was fun!

### Day 3: January 2, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Back to some work with react-native and navigating. I got multiple components to interact and nav to each other, rather than just one component loading different props.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not conceptually sound on the inner workings of nav. Need to really figure that out.

### Day 4: January 3, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Met with new colleagues/work members on a side project I'm now a part of. Just getting up to speed/understanding the codebase. Not too much done in terms of pure coding.

**Thoughts:** Would have liked to get more done, but I'm just glad I didn't go right to bed/watch netflix after a long day.

### Day 5: January 4, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Looked into react-native-router-flux, and got up to speed and using it almost immediately. It's really amazing.

**Thoughts:** Attempted to get it to play nicely with the big project, but I think there are some issues with our redux.

### Day 6: January 5, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Some part of my app was broken, so I fixed that. I found out what it really means to pass in functions as props in react. ie, prop={action.name} is passing in a function, whereas prop={action.name()} is not. You'd have to do something like prop={() => action.name()} to call a function if you wanted the () executor.

**Thoughts:** There's so much to learn! My next step is passing in date information from the Calendar, to the specific day, and then passing that information BACK to the calendar so it can be updated. Once I figure out how to pass the props to the DayScene, I think I'll implement redux.

### Day 7: January 6, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I worked pretty late, and my brain was a bit fried. I got stuck passing in props to a calendar component because I didn't read well enough >.<.

**Thoughts:** Got props passing back to a day container! I need to start coding earlier. But, it's rough with work. Means I have to wake up much earlier.

### Day 8: January 7, 2017
**Today's Progress:** I got it to work! I actually read, and the props are passing, things are showing, and the calendar looks /okay/. I'll need to work on the styling a bit more.

**Thoughts:** I did quite a bit of work today, and also got an hour of hard exercise. I think that really helped my overall brain functioning. I'm going to start waking up early more often!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
