# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Decided to work on a project I've wanted to make, decided to develop in React-Native. Created the repo, and started working on some basic routing.

**Thoughts:** I need to figure out routing in r-n.

###Day 2: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** My step dad mentioned his difficulties for analyzing stock data, and I thought that it'd be a pretty easily thing to automate. Unfortunately, some of the sites that he used did not have any apis, so I learned how to utilize selenium, and wrote a python script to do it for him. He wanted it output into an excel file, so I just output it into a .csv file that he can open in excel.

**Thoughts:** Wasn't too hard. I ran into some road blocks, mostly with remembering how to do large array manipulations. I looked back onto some of the code I wrote in undergrad to analyze astronomical data. Was fun!

### Day 3: January 2, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Back to some work with react-native and navigating. I got multiple components to interact and nav to each other, rather than just one component loading different props.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not conceptually sound on the inner workings of nav. Need to really figure that out.

### Day 4: January 3, 2017
**Today's Progress:** Met with new colleagues/work members on a side project I'm now a part of. Just getting up to speed/understanding the codebase. Not too much done in terms of pure coding.

**Thoughts:** Would have liked to get more done, but I'm just glad I didn't go right to bed/watch netflix after a long day.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
